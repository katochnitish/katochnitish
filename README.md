**Hello**

**I‚Äôm Nitish Katoch and I work for [Impedance Imaging Research Center (IIRC)](https://iirc.khu.ac.kr/), College of Medicine, [Kyung Hee University](https://www.khu.ac.kr/eng/main/index.do), Seoul, South Korea. I am interested in MRI and MR-based imaging techniques. I am a PhD. in Biomedical Engineering and I mostly works on MR based Conductivity Imaging. I‚Äôm currently learning ML, and QSM.**

**Primary Research Topics**

**Electrical and magnetic properties of the brain**
- Explore electrical and magnetic properties of brain and novel contrast mechanism for future brain imaging
- Conductivity tensor imaging (CTI)
- Diffusion- Magnetic resonance eletrical impedance tomography (DT-MREIT)
- Magnetic resonance eletrical impedance tomography (MREIT)
- Magnetic resonance current density imaging (MRCDI)

**Electrical stimulation modalities**
- tDCS, tMS, and tACS

**Diffusion tensor imaging**
- Develop and apply new methology to microstructure imaging

**Functional MRI & EEG**
- Brain connectivity analysis using EEG and fMRI
