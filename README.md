**Hello**

**I‚Äôm Nitish Katoch and I work for [Impedance Imaging Research Center (IIRC)](https://iirc.khu.ac.kr/), College of Medicine, [Kyung Hee University](https://www.khu.ac.kr/eng/main/index.do), Seoul, South Korea. I'm interested in MRIs and MR-based imaging techniques. I earned my PhD in biomedical engineering and primarily focus on MR-based conductivity imaging. I'm currently studying machine learning and quantitative susceptibility methods (QSM).**

**Primary Research Topics**

**Electrical and magnetic properties of the brain**
- Explore electrical and magnetic properties of brain and novel contrast mechanism for future brain imaging (Quantitative conductivity mapping-QCM)
- Conductivity tensor imaging (CTI)
- Diffusion- Magnetic resonance eletrical impedance tomography (DT-MREIT)
- Magnetic resonance eletrical impedance tomography (MREIT)
- Magnetic resonance current density imaging (MRCDI)
- Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)

**Electrical stimulation modalities**
- tDCS, tMS, and tACS

**Diffusion tensor imaging**
- Develop and apply new methology to microstructure imaging

**Functional MRI & EEG**
- Brain connectivity analysis using EEG and fMRI
